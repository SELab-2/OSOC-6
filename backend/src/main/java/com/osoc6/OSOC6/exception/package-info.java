/**
 * This module contains all exceptions and handlers used for the API.
 * We need custom exceptions to specify things going wrong in our code and to sanitize input.
 * Handling those exceptions is done in advisors.
 * Advisors make sure the backend doesn't just throw an error but also informs the user.
